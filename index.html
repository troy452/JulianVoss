                    Julian Voss is a chronicler of the unseen and a historian of the world’s most terrifying elemental anomalies. Specializing in "Hydrological Gothic" and "Industrial Horror," Voss reimagines history’s greatest disasters not as mere accidents, but as moments where the fabric of reality fundamentally fractured. From the sentient, fungal-choked fields of the Irish Great Hunger to the molten, geometric nightmares of 1920s Tokyo, Voss’s work explores the "Elemental Catastrophe"—a series of narratives where nature ceases to be a backdrop and becomes a predatory, transformative force. Known for a "Found Document" aesthetic and rigorous period research, his novels challenge the boundary between historical fact and cosmic dread. When not archiving the Earth’s most violent secrets, Voss resides in a quiet corner of the world where the soil remains silent—for now.

The world is not just ending; it is dissolving.

The year is 1200 BCE. The great bronze empires of the Mediterranean—Egypt, the Hittites, and the Mycenaean Greeks—are melting into a landscape of terminal decay. The sky has turned a permanent, bruised purple, and the air is thick with the scent of ozone and burning cedar.

Kaelen is a scavenger of lost things. While the kings of old cling to their crumbling thrones, Kaelen survives in the ruins, speaking to the "Shadow of Bronze." But when he uncovers an intricately engraved brass relic embedded in the chest of a fallen warrior, he triggers a vision of a final, weightless end.

The Nameless Swarm has arrived.

Out of a boiling black sea come the Sea Peoples—not men, but towering, barnacle-encrusted husks driven by a hive-mind from the lightless trenches. They do not come to conquer; they come to return the world to salt.

As Kaelen leads a band of desperate refugees across a scorched world, he must master the relic’s terrifying power: the Authority of Solidity. To save the future, he may have to petrify the present into dead, cold stone.

In a land without law, the only crown is made of thorns.

England, 1140 AD. The kingdom is a frozen graveyard. For nineteen years, a brutal civil war known as "The Anarchy" has torn the earth apart as Empress Matilda and King Stephen fight for a throne that rests on a mountain of bones. Every castle is a jagged tooth biting into a leaden sky, and the air tastes of iron and wet fur.

Elias is a knight who has lost everything but his shadow. Disgraced and hunted, he moves through the frozen mud of the countryside. But Elias carries a secret more dangerous than any sword: his shadow is a snarling, multi-headed beast that hungers for the very chaos that surrounds him.

The Iron Queen is coming.

Empress Matilda has fused her soul with the cold stone of her unlicensed "adulterine" fortresses. She does not want a kingdom; she wants a "Frozen Peace" where the peasantry are the mortar between her stones.

When Elias is tasked with smuggling a child—the "True Spark"—through a tunnel of human ribs, he realizes the boy’s life is the only thing standing between England and an eternal, frozen winter. To save the future, Elias must unleash the beast in his shadow and tear down the throne of thorns.

"The Throne of Thorns" is a gritty, visceral reimagining of English history, blending the political betrayal of "Game of Thrones" with the cosmic dread of H.P. Lovecraft.

The American West didn't just fall—it drowned.

California, 1862. It hasn't stopped raining for forty-three days. The Central Valley, once a land of golden promise, has been transformed into a three-hundred-mile inland sea. The air is thick with the scent of "sweet rot," and the rising brine is claiming everything in its path.

Silas is a man of the earth, now forced to survive the water. As his ranch house detaches from its foundation, Silas must use "chains of Anchored Will" to keep his family from being swept into the black, churning abyss. But the water isn't just rising; it’s remembering.

The flood has a voice. Out of the mists come the ghosts of the frontier, and a seductive song that promises a weightless life to those who simply let go and sink. Silas must navigate a landscape of floating ruins, escaped predators, and desperate bandits while the water continues to rise.

In a world that has become a watery grave, can one man’s will hold back the tide?

"The Drowning Frontier" is a visceral survival thriller that blends the dark realism of historical disaster with the cosmic dread of H.P. Lovecraft.

Five Days of Darkness. A City Choking on its Past.

In the Great Smog of London, 1952, breathing is a death sentence—and the fog isn't just smoke.

December 1952: A freak anticyclone settles over London, trapping the soot of a million coal fires in a lethal yellow-black shroud. For five days without sun, the city is swallowed whole. The infamous "Pea-Souper" is so thick that flare-men must walk before ambulances to light the way through a silent, suffocating labyrinth. It was history’s deadliest environmental disaster in modern Britain.

But this is no ordinary historical disaster novel.

As the Black Air fills the lungs of the city, the foundations of time begin to dissolve. Within the toxic fog, something ancient stirs. The Soot-Wraiths emerge—predatory shadows born of industrial ruin, manifestations of London’s darkest eras, given form by the very carbon that is killing the living.

In this slow burn atmospheric horror set during the Great Smog of 1952, the past refuses to stay buried.

For a young flare-man lost in the haze, Westminster’s familiar streets twist into plague-infested alleys of 1665. The air grows thinner. The bells fall silent. And as the death toll rises, he must navigate a city where history itself has turned hostile.

This industrial gothic horror novel blends historical fiction, environmental catastrophe, and cosmic dread into a haunting supernatural thriller where breath becomes betrayal—and the city remembers.

Welcome to a work of historical atmospheric horror fiction where the fog is alive… and London is choking on more than smoke.

 Two ships. One hundred and twenty-nine men. And a sea that is no longer made of water.

In 1845, Sir John Franklin set sail to find the Northwest Passage, equipped not just with reinforced hulls, but with the Aetheric Ram—an experimental engine designed to thin the fabric of reality and bypass the physical world entirely.

But when the HMS Erebus and Terror become locked in the crushing grip of the Victoria Strait, the engines don't stop. They begin to bleed a sentient, iridescent fog from the "Beyond" into the Arctic circle. As the sun vanishes for the long polar night, the crew succumb to "The Transparency."

It is a biological breakdown that mimics scurvy, but instead of losing teeth, the men lose their opacity. They become The Luminous—sailors who are half-ghost while still breathing, their bodies revealing the glowing clockwork of the engines within.

In a landscape where the stars have rearranged and the ice speaks in the voices of the dead, the survivors must choose: fade into the beautiful, silent white of the Aether, or commit unthinkable acts to anchor their souls to the rotting wood of the ships.
"The Aether-Vessel’s Wake" is a masterful blend of naval history and cosmic horror—a journey into the deep, enduring memory of the ice.                      </p>

 The Sun has set on the Age of Reason.

1815: In the heart of the Dutch East Indies, Mount Tambora screams. It is the loudest sound in recorded history—a geological execution that sends a mountain of ash into the stratosphere, veiling the world in a "Dry Fog" that will not lift.

1816: Across the globe, summer never arrives. In New England, "brown snow" falls in June. In Europe, the Napoleonic Wars have ended, but a new enemy has emerged: Famine. As bread riots turn to blood in the streets, the world begins to wonder if the Creator has finally turned His back on humanity.

Inside the Villa Diodati: Trapped by relentless, sulfur-stained storms on the shores of Lake Geneva, Mary Shelley and a circle of poets engage in a dark competition to pass the time. But Mary isn't just writing a ghost story. She is breathing in the Embers of Tambora—microscopic particles that grant her visions of a world made of ash, and a monster that reflects the dying light of the sun.

In the charred remains of Sumbawa: A lone survivor of the initial blast wanders a landscape turned to glass, carrying a secret that could explain why the sun refused to return.

The Ash-Glass Sky is a sweeping, multi-perspective epic that weaves historical truth with a haunting, metaphysical mystery. It is a story of a world caught in a "baptism by fire," where the only thing more terrifying than the darkness outside is the darkness we find within ourselves when the light goes out.

For fans of The Terror, Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, and rich, atmospheric historical fiction, Julian Voss delivers a stunning reimagining of the year the world went cold.

 1845: 129 Men. Two Ships. One Ancient Hunger. They set out to conquer the ice. The ice decided to keep them.

Sir John Franklin’s expedition was supposed to be the crowning jewel of the British Empire. Equipped with the cutting-edge steam power of the HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, the mission to find the Northwest Passage was deemed "unsinkable."

But as the "White Summer" fades into a "Black Winter" that refuses to end, the iron-ribbed ships become frozen tombs. For Captain Francis Crozier, the danger isn't just the rotting food or the lead-induced madness—it is the "Blue Fog" that creeps across the ice, a supernatural force that feeds on the crew's deepest fears and manifests their sins into the spectral Still-Walkers.

n a land where time distorts and the Aurora Borealis hums with a malevolent rhythm, the line between Victorian science and Gothic nightmare dissolves. To survive, the crew must march across a jagged wasteland, dragging the weight of an Empire that has already forgotten them.

Step into the "Great Silence." If you enjoyed the chilling atmosphere of The Terror and the historical depth of Master and Commander, you will be haunted by this epic reimagining of history’s greatest maritime mystery.

 The Mandate of Heaven has been withdrawn. The Dragon is waking up.

1931: After a decade of drought and the scars of civil war, the heart of China is parched. The people pray for rain. They receive an apocalypse.

In a single month, seven cyclonic storms collide over the Yangtze River. The dikes that have held for centuries groan and shatter, unleashing a wall of water that transforms the ancestral plains into a boundless, gray inland sea. It is the deadliest natural disaster in human history—but the water is only the beginning.

The Iron Silt: From the depths of the riverbeds, a black, unnaturally heavy sediment rises. It is the "Iron Silt," a substance that carries the collective memory of five thousand years of drowning. Those who touch it don't just see the flood; they relive the lives and deaths of every soul the river has ever claimed.

In the flooded streets of Wuhan: A Western-trained engineer watches his blueprints wash away, realizing that physics cannot stop a mythological fury. To save the city, he must choose which provinces to sacrifice to the tide.

On the dikes of Gaoyou: A mother clings to a rooftop with her children, fighting not just the rising current and the specter of famine, but the haunting visions brought by the silt—ghosts of ancient dynasties demanding to be heard.

The Dragon’s Deluge is a visceral, hauntingly beautiful epic of survival. It is a story of a civilization at a breaking point, where the line between historical tragedy and supernatural reckoning dissolves in the rain.

A masterpiece of "Liquid Gothic" horror and historical drama. If you were captivated by the atmospheric dread of The Terror and the epic scale of The Good Earth, you will be swept away by Julian Voss’s most ambitious novel yet.

 A Continent of Dust. A Fever of Gold. In the deep leads of Ballarat, the price of a fortune is your soul.

854: The Australian frontier is a raw wound torn into the earth. Thousands of prospectors from across the globe have descended upon the ochre plains of Victoria, driven by a desperate hunger for the wealth buried in the jagged quartz reefs. But the British Crown’s grip is tightening, and the "License Hunts" have turned the goldfields into a powder keg of resentment.

Beneath the surface, a darker infection spreads. The "Fool’s Fever"—a supernatural amber glow found in the deepest, most claustrophobic tunnels—is driving men to a prophetic madness. They aren't just finding gold; they are seeing visions of their own future wealth and the violent ends it will bring.

As the Irish rebel Peter Lalor rallies the diggers behind the tattered Southern Cross flag, the line between a fight for liberty and a descent into mania dissolves. In the pre-dawn shadows of the Eureka Stockade, the miners must decide if they are fighting for their freedom or for the cursed earth that is slowly claiming them.

The Earth Didn’t Just Shake. It Spoke.

In this haunting work of historical cosmic horror fiction, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake becomes something far more terrifying than a natural disaster.

In 1906, San Francisco was the “Paris of the West,” a city of marble, ambition, and rising steel. But on the morning of April 18th, the San Andreas Fault did more than rupture—it exhaled.

As the city collapsed and the Great Fire raged, a prehistoric mineral vapor known as the Lithic Breath seeped from the deep fissures, carrying with it a concentrated geological memory trapped beneath the peninsula for eons. What history would record as a catastrophic earthquake was only the beginning.

While flames consumed the surface, a darker transformation unfolded in the ruins. The dust of fallen buildings did not settle—it began to breathe.

Those who inhale the pulverized stone succumb to The Calcification.

In this slow burn geological horror novel set during the 1906 San Francisco disaster, the human body becomes battleground and monument. Soft tissue hardens into igneous rock and quartz. The afflicted become The Statuesque—living monuments frozen mid-struggle, their consciousness fused forever with the bedrock.

As the city fractures, survivors must navigate a landscape where the earth itself is awakening. Streets shift. Foundations groan. Stone remembers.

Blending historical disaster fiction, atmospheric gothic horror, and supernatural dread, The Fault-Line Echoes is a literary disaster horror novel where the land is not merely shaken—it is sentient.

San Francisco was never built on the earth.

It was built from it.

And now, the earth wants it back.

 The earth broke the city. The wind set it ablaze. And the fire... it began to hunt.

Tokyo, September 1, 1923.

It began at noon. A massive tectonic shift turned the elegance of the Taisho era into a landscape of splintered wood and rising dust. But for Kenji Sato, a young architect obsessed with the "fluidity" of structures, the earthquake was only the invitation.

As the city collapsed, the real horror emerged from the fissures: the Akuma-no-kaze—the Devil’s Wind. These weren't just fire tornadoes fueled by high winds; they were lashing, serpentine coils of living heat that moved with a predatory grace. They didn't just burn buildings; they sought out the crowded plazas of the Rikugun Honjo Hifukusho, surrounding thousands in a ring of sentient flame.

The fire doesn't flicker; it breathes. The smoke doesn't drift; it reaches. Kenji realizes that the earthquake has torn a hole in the "Dragon’s Vein" beneath Tokyo, and the Inferno is the tail of something ancient finally lashing out at the surface.

 100 miles. One night. A single line of tracks that walked over houses, walls, and frozen rivers.

The snow fell on the county like a white shroud, burying the moors in silence. When the sun rose, the world had changed. Residents opened their doors to find a phenomenon that defied explanation: a single line of cloven hoofprints, stretching unbroken for over a hundred miles.

They didn't stop for walls. They didn't break the ice of the Exe Estuary. They marched over thatched roofs and through haystacks as if the physical world meant nothing. The clergy called it the Devil’s Walk. The scientists called it a biological anomaly.

Cartographer Thomas Vane knows they are both wrong.

Tasked with mapping the phenomenon for the Royal Society, Vane discovers a terrifying pattern hidden in the path of the prints. The creature wasn’t just walking; it was searching. And as Vane follows the trail toward the coast, he realizes the tracks aren't sitting on the snow—they are sinking into a hollow earth beneath it.

From the frozen moors of Dartmoor to the fog-choked alleys of Exeter, Vane must race to decipher the message left in the snow before the snow melts... and releases what is hiding underneath.

 The levee didn't just break. It bled.

Mississippi Delta, 1927.

The rain has been falling for months, turning the rich soil of the Delta into a hungry, sucking maw. The Mississippi River is a bloated, brown god, straining against the man-made levees that dare to hold it back. But as the water crests, it brings more than just silt and debris.

To the thousands trapped in the squalid levee camps, the flood is a humanitarian disaster. But to Silas "Blind-Eye" Walker, a bluesman who can hear the "pitch" of the water, the river is singing a song of cold steel. The currents aren't moving like water; they are cutting through the landscape with the precision of a thousand blades. Houses aren't being swept away—they are being carved into kindling.

The "knives" in the water aren't metal; they are the frozen, sharpened wills of those the river has claimed over centuries, now forming a liquid edge that seeks to "prune" the living from the land. As the Great Flood swallows the South, Silas must navigate a landscape where the very water is a weapon, and the only way to survive is to play a chord that the river finally respects.

 The fire didn't just burn the city. It was drawing a map.

Chicago, October 1871.

The "White City" is a tinderbox of pine, coal, and ambition. When the first spark ignites on DeKoven Street, the world sees a tragedy of urban planning. But Elias Thorne, a visionary architect obsessed with the "hidden geometry" of city grids, sees a ritual.

As the Great Fire sweeps through the South Side, it moves with an impossible, mathematical precision. The flames don't flicker—they flow in perfectly straight lines, turning the streets into a glowing, amber circuit board. This isn't just a fire; it is an awakening. The heat is flash-fusing the rubble into a conductive network, and the screams of the city are being harvested as power.

Elias realizes that the "Grid" he helped design was never meant for humans to live in. It was a blueprint for a massive, living battery. Now, as the firestorm reaches the Chicago River, the Architect must decide: will he break the circuit and save the survivors, or allow the Amber Grid to complete its final, terrifying connection?

 They called it the Dust Bowl. They were wrong. The earth didn't just dry up. It woke up.

Kansas, 1935.

The rain stopped five years ago. Now, the sky is a bruised purple bruise, and the ground is spitting up its dead.

To the government, the "Black Rollers" burying the Midwest are just weather—a tragic mix of drought and poor farming. But Elias Thorne, a photographer for the Works Progress Administration (WPA), has seen what the dust leaves behind.

It isn't just soil. It is ancient.

Through his lens, Thorne captures things that shouldn't exist: farmhouses swallowed whole not by drifts, but by a shifting landscape that moves with intent. Children who cough up grey silt that whispers in the quiet of the night. And a horizon that is getting closer every day.

The locals call it "The Grinding." The geologists call it impossible. But as the greatest storm of the century—Black Sunday—approaches, Thorne realizes the terrifying truth:

We are not walking on dirt. We are walking on skin. And it is hungry.

 The sky shattered. The earth fused. And then, the statues began to walk.

Siberia, 1908.

In a single, blinding flash, eight hundred square miles of forest were flattened. The world called it a meteor. The locals called it a warning.

But when a retrieval team led by Captain Aleksei Volkov reaches the epicenter, they find a landscape that has been transformed. The intense heat of the "Tunguska Event" hasn't just scorched the earth—it has flash-vitrified the permafrost, turning the Siberian wilderness into a jagged, razor-sharp labyrinth of black glass.

But the glass is not empty.

Trapped within the translucent shards are the "Walkers"—beings that look like men but move like light through a prism. They don't bleed; they refract. They don't breathe; they vibrate. And they are spreading. As the glass begins to grow over the skin of the survivors like a crystalline plague, Volkov realizes that the "meteor" wasn't a rock from space. It was a lens.

Now, the sun is rising over the taiga, and as the light hits the glass, the screaming begins.

Ireland, 1847.

The emerald hills are turning black. The staple crop of a nation is rotting in the earth, but the rot is not silent. It pulses. It breathes. It communicates.

To the British authorities, the Great Famine is a logistical failure. To the starving millions, it is a divine punishment. But to Cillian O’Shea, a disgraced botanist returning to his ancestral home in County Cork, the blight is something far more ancient—and far more sentient.

The "Blight" isn't a fungus killing the potatoes; it is a mycelial network that has been dormant for millennia, now rising to reclaim the land. It doesn't just consume the crops; it consumes the memories, the voices, and the very biology of those who eat it.

As Cillian watches his neighbors begin to change—their veins turning to root-fibers, their eyes clouding with white spores—he realizes the terrifying truth: The earth has issued a Mandate. We are no longer the masters of the soil. We are its nutrients.

In a land where the living envy the dead, Cillian must decide if he will fight the spread or become another node in the earth’s burgeoning, horrific collective mind.
